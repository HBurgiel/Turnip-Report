# Rose Hip Jelly
https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/rose_hip_jelly/

The jelly is boring, but it's supposed to be high in vitamin C and foraging is fun!

Boil for an hour or until soft:
- 8 cups rose hips with flower end cut off
- 6 cups water or enough to cover the rose hips

Mash.

Strain through 4 sheets of cheese cloth or whatever (the seeds aren't fun to eat) to get juice.

Boil:
- 3 c juice
1/2 c lemon juice
6 T pectin
1/4 t butter
3 1/2 c sugar
