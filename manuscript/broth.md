I like to save things like kale and broccoli stems to make into broth. It's also a really good way to use up things like parsnips and turnips. (But not uncooked rice -- ask me how I know!) 
When I was first learning to make broth, I learned that adding salt improves the flavor and that using too much of a single ingredient is detrimental to the flavor. 
I generally don't add salt; I can do that when I make the soup.

Generally, ingredients are washed and coarsely chopped.

Ingredient lists are approximate -- you do you!

# Recipe 1, in which we cook the onions
- In a large pot, sautee
  -   3T oil
  -   onion
  -   garlic
- Add
  -   celery
  -   carrot
  -   fresh veggie stems
- Add
     - water to cover -- cold or boiling
     - large potato
     - turnip
     - parsnip
     - frozen veggie stems
     - bay leaf
     - 6-10 black peppercorns
- Bring to a boil.
- Simmer on low heat for up to three hours.
- Strain and store.

# Recipe 2, in which we start with pot liquor
After boiling a cabbage, fish the large pieces out with a slotted tool rather than pouring the water down the drain. Add ingredients (e.g. the ones listed in Recipe 1), bring to a boil, simmer, strain, and store.
