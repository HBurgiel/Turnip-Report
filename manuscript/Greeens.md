# Saag Paneer
Based on: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/authentic-saag-paneer/

I use kale in this recipe. If you're using a milder green you can get away with swapping out the cream for yoghurt, but I won't do that with kale. 
Puree and freeze the kale, then prepare this any time. Paneer freezes well too.
