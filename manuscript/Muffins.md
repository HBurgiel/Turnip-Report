I've tried many different recipes, and muffins tend to be the tastiest and most convenient way to use up many of the vegetables I get each year.

I am not the sort of person who sifts the dry ingredients into a separate bowl for mixing. I just carefully dump them on top of the liquid ingredients, carefully stir the dry ingredients at the top before mixing in the wet at the bottom, and hope for the best.

# Chocolate Beet Muffins
I guessed it must be possible to make a sort of red velvet cupcake using beets for color. I was half right --
the flavor profile of the beets takes some effort to balance. Luckily, I found [this recipe](https://thelunacafe.com/heavenly-chocolate-beet-tea-loaf/).
