# Cabbage Pierogi Filling
Based on my prababcia Burgiel's recipe. She used George Washington's Golden Seasoning in place of Better Than Boullion, so don't fuss about authenticity. 
I generally eat it over egg noodles. If you actually want to fill pierogi, chill it and maybe squeeze out liquid in addition to draining the cabbage.

- Quarter and core
  - 1 head cabbage
- Boil for 5-10 minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid to make broth if you like.
- Sautee
  - 1/4-1/2 c. butter
  - 1 onion
- Stir in
  - Chopped cooked cabbage
  - 1-2 t Better Than Boullion -- chicken or maybe mushroom flavor
  - 1/3 t pepper
- Cook over medium heat until cabbage begins to brown a bit and get mushy, maybe 30 minutes.
