Following the instructions provided by [Forge Baking Co.](https://www.forgebakingco.com/)

Let the dough warm up, rest, and soften for at least an hour before baking.

Preheat oven to 500 degrees.

Pour 1 or 2 tablespoons olive oil onto a jelly roll pan type cookie sheet. Open a container of corn meal and have your dough handy.

Spread the oil with your hands, then sprinkle it with corn meal. Put the dough on the cookie sheet and gently spread with oily hands. If the dough resists, take a break and try again in 15 minutes.

Once the dough is spread, salt and pepper it then top with sauce, cheese, etc.

Lower the oven to 450 degrees. Bake until the crust browns and the cheese melts, about 10-15 minutes.
