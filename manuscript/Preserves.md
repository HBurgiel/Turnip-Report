# Rose Hip Jelly
https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/rose_hip_jelly/

The jelly is boring, but it's supposed to be high in vitamin C and foraging is fun!

Boil for an hour or until soft:
- 8 cups rose hips with flower end cut off
- 6 cups water or enough to cover the rose hips

Mash.

Strain through 4 sheets of cheese cloth or whatever (the seeds aren't fun to eat) to get juice.

Boil:
- 3 c juice
- 1/2 c lemon juice
- 6 T pectin
- 1/4 t butter
- 3 1/2 c sugar

# Plum Jam
My mother made something she called "plum gumbo". I don't know if I ever had the recipe, and I've long since forogtten whether it actually included walnuts. Here's what's currently in the breadbot:

Wash and chop:
- 2 c tart plums
- 1/2 lemon, including peel

Stir in:
- 3/4 c sugar
- 2 T pectin
- dash of cloves

Cook until it's jam, then put in jars. I'm totally winging it with the jars and the sterilizing and the boiling it after -- maybe there are instructions included with your jars? Also, make sure to wipe all the goo off the rim of the jar before you put the seal of the lid on it.
