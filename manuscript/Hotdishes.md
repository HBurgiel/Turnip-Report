I'm not Minnesotan, but I can't bring myself to call a lasagne a "casserole" and that's the sort of recipe I want on this page.
Note that there's a separate page for savory bread puddings if you don't find what you want here.

# Mostaccioli Al Forno

This recipe is from my stepmother. It's pretty easy to assemble, you can substitute whatever minced greens you have in the
freezer for spinach, and it's fairly forgiving. Also, it's got a lot of cheese in it.

- Cook and drain
  - 1 c. frozen chopped spinach

- Stir in
  - 2 c. ricotta cheese
  - 3 eggs
  - 1/3 c. Parmesan cheese
  - 2/3 c. grated mozzarella
  - 1/3 c. chopped fresh parsley
  - 1 tsp. salt
  - 1/4 tsp. pepper

- Combine
  - 8 oz. cooked mostaccioli / penne
  - 2 c. pasta sauce

- Spread half the noodles in a 9/13 baking pan
- cover with spinach mixture
- cover with the rest of the noodles

- Sprinkle with
  - 1/3 c. grated mozzarella
   -2 T. Parmesan cheese

- Bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes
