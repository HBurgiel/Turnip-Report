# About this book

In a perfect world, I'd subsist primarily on hot chocolate, cheese pizza, and orange soda. This doesn't work in practice, so I've gamified my nutritional choice-making by subscribing to a farmshare. This works well for me because I'm a vegetarian, I enjoy figuring out what to do with ingredients, I'm an experienced cook, and I hate wasting food.

There are very few actual turnip recipes in the book. The title dates back to the year I subscribed for a winter produce share; hilarity ensued. I reserve the right to change the title if I think of a better one.

All of my recipes are inspired by other recipes. I've tried to cite sources where I can. A notable exception is my college room-mate's ex-boyfriend's mother's recipe book. If you see a credit like "J's mother", that's probably where the recipe came from.
